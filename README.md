Joe Klinger Project 4 - Shape Grammars

To create my city, i used a concentric pattern for road layout, and then placed buildings along the roads. After 5 iterations my shape grammar rules make the starting geometry subdivide and scale to create procedural building-type thingies. I am sampling perlin noise to scale the general building height to simulate population density. I also added godzilla, shadows and fog to complete the mastapiece.
