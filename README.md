# Shape Grammar 

For this project I used a shape grammar system to build a town and its surrounding environment.

# Project Description 

I have five rules which operate on a basic house mesh to subdivide, scale, and move the the house generated. One rule is a scaling rule, one imports in new geometry, two rules involve subdividing into two meshes, and the final rule subdivides into three. Once I completed the building grammar, I appended the houses onto spline curves which border a lake. Finally, I created a forest by using a noise function to generate positions for a collection of trees.
