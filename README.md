# Shape Grammars

Disclaimer: this is not finished as expected, because of the unexpected complexities of convex hull operations. 
However it does have a procedural city with different rules for mass volumes (lot shape and profile), as described in the original paper. 

It does not (for now) use any per-component rule (such as windows); although it is implemented, more time is needed to build the obj library.
