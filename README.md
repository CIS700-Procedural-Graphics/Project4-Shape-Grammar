# L-System 

For this project I generated an L-System parser, and used it to visualize a bamboo plant.

# Description 

To implement the L-system, I used a linked list to store each symbol for efficient replacements in each iteration. The grammar is then mapped to produce visualizations of base branches, dividers, small branches, and leaves. The rules that I made affected the angle at which the bamboo grows, the amount of leaves produced, and the ability for the bamboo plant to branch.
