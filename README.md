# Project 4: Shape Grammar

For this assignment you'll be building directly off of Project 3. To make things easier to keep track of, please fork and clone this repository [https://github.com/CIS700-Procedural-Graphics/Project4-Shape-Grammar](https://github.com/CIS700-Procedural-Graphics/Project4-Shape-Grammar) and copy your Project 3 code to start.

**Goal:** to model an urban environment using a shape grammar. 

**Note:** Weâ€™re well aware that a nice-looking procedural city is a lot of work for a single week. Focus on designing a nice building grammar. The city layout strategies outlined in class (the extended l-systems) are complex and not expected. We will be satisfied with something reasonably simple, just not a uniform grid!

## Symbol Node (5 points)
Shape class

## Grammar design (55 points)
- Subdivision of buildings
- Floors
- Roofs on top floor
- Columns on bottom floor
- I have the geometry to make onings, but alas I didn't end up using it.


## Create a city (30 points)
- Regular ground plane (I understand, I'm sorry)
- Made multiple buildings

## Make it interesting (10)
- Well, I was going to go for the forbidden city, but that didn't work out.
But I am satisfied to the point I got to despite the point allocation.

Submitted Late.
